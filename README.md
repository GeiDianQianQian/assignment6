# assignment6
The assignment is for analyzing A/B Testing and T-test.

A/B Testing:
- Give file searches.json
- Create a program ab_analysis.py by applying an nonparametric test
- The purpose of A/B Testing is analyzing the provided data to get p-values.
- p-values = stats.mannwhitneyu(X,Y).pvalue

Benchmarking Sorting:
 - The purpose is be benchmarking some code to see how it performs, and analysing the results for statistical significance.
 - In the provided implementations.py, there are several different sorting algorithms.
 - Create a program create_data.py for analyzing which sorting implementations are faster/slower/indistinguishable
